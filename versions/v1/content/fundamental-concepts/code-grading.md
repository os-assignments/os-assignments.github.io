## Mandatory code grading

During the mandatory **code grading sessions** for module 1 each pair will meet with one member of the teaching staff
for a **15 minute** code grading session. During the code grading you
will present and discuss your solution to the module 1 [mandatory assignment](../assignment). A
working solution is not enough. During
the code grading you must show that you understand the concepts used in the
assignment and that you can explain how your solution works.

You will be graded fail or pass (3) individually.

## Retake code grading

If you fail the mandatory code
grading for the mandatory assignment you must attend the retake code grading session for module 1
and no longer has
the opportunity to get a higher grade than pass (3) for the module 1 assignment.

## Higher grade code grading

If you pass the mandatory code grading for module 1 you have the opportunity to
solve the optional [higher grade assignment](../higher-grade) 
and present your solution during the higher grade code grading session for
module 1.

No matter if one or both students in the pair qualify or choose to attend the
higher grade code grading, you will always be scheduled using the pair number
for the higher grade code grading.

During the higher grade code grading you will always be graded
individually, that is, students in a pair may receive different grades (3, 4 or 5).
