need to be familiar with the following C programming concepts.

* Basic data types such as `int` and `char`.
* Arrays.
* Strings (array of `char`).
* Basic use of the `#define` directive.
* Basic use of `printf()` to print text to the terminal.
* The `if-then-else` control structure.
* The `switch` control structure.
* The `while` loop.
