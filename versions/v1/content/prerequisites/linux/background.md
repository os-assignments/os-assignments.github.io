A short background of Unix and Linux and why Linux is used in the operating
systems courses. 

## Unix

[Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) is a family of [multitasking][multitasking],
multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix,
developed in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis
Ritchie, and others[^unix].

## Linux

[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) is a name which broadly denotes a
family of free and [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) software operating system distributions built
around the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel). The defining component of a Linux distribution is the
Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17,
1991 by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)[^linux].

Linux is a [Unix-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) and
mostly [POSIX-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) computer operating
system[^linux]. As of May 2015 it is estimated that 96.55% of all web servers
runs Linux [^linux-market-share].

## The basic principles of Unix and Linux

Unix has a very long history both in industry and academia. Compared to proprietary
operating systems such
as [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows)
and [Mac OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) detailed information about
the design and implementation of Unix and Linux is much easier to find.
As a consequence, Unix/Linux is well suited when studying and learning the core
principles of operating systems. 

In the the operating systems courses at Uppsala University:

- Both Unix and Linux will be used to introduce
  the basic principles of operating systems. 
- Linux will be used for all tutorials and programming assignments.
