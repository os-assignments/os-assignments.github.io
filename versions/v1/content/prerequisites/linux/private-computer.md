Since there might be minor variations among various Linux distributions, the
only fully supported platform for tutorials and programming assignments is the [department
Ubuntu Linux System](department-linux-system). 

- All provided source code have been developed and 
  tested on the department Ubuntu Linux system.
- All written instructions target the 
  the department Ubuntu Linux system.

If you wish to use your private computer for the tutorials and programming
assignments there are a few options. 

## Linux

If you have a fairly modern version of Linux installed you will most likely be
able to work on the tutorials and programming assignments without any trouble. 

## Mac OS X 

If you plan to use Mac OS X you will most likely be able to
do so with out much trouble. But, there may be minor differences between Linux
and Mac OS X that requires you to make minor adjustments.

## Windows

If you plan to use Windows for the problem sets you must be prepared to sort out
all sorts of issues on your own. You are most likely much better off installing
Linux.

### The Windows subsystem for Linux

If you are using Windows 10 you could try out
the [Windows subsystem for Linux][wp-wsl] (WSL) that lets developers run Linux environments -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a virtual machine. More information about WSL including instructions for installing WSL on Windows 10 can be found [here][wsl-home].

### VirtalBox

If you don't want to install Linux on your computer, you can try to install
[VirtualBox][virtualbox] and run a virtual Linux machine. 
 This [tutorial][installing-ubuntu-on-virtual-box] will cover how to install VirtualBox and set up your first virtual
machine, show you how to get Ubuntu and prepare for installation, and walk you
through an installation of Ubuntu.
