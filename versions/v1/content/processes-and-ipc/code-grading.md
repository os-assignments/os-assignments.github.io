## Equipment 

You may bring your private laptop for the code grading or you may use the
department Linux system. 


## Mandatory code grading

Each pair will meet with one member of the teaching staff
for a **15 minute** code grading session. During the code grading you
will present and discuss your solution to the module 2 mandatory assignments [signals](../signals) and [pipeline](../pipeline). 
Working solutions are not enough. During
the code grading you must show that you understand the concepts used in the
assignments and that you can explain how your solutions works.

## Retake code grading

If you fail the code
grading for the mandatory assignments you must attend the retake code grading
and no longer has
the opportunity to get a higher grade than pass (3) for the module 2 assignment.

## Higher grade code grading

If you pass the the code grading you have the opportunity to solve the optional [shell](../shell) higher grade assignment 
and present your solution during a higher grade code grading session.

No matter if one or both students in the pair qualify or choose to attend the
higher grade code grading, you will always be scheduled using the pair number
for the higher grade code grading.

{{% note class="warning" title="Grading" %}}

During the higher grade code grading you will always be graded
individually, that is, students in a pair may receive different grades (3, 4 or 5).
