The programming assignments have been developed and tested on the [department
Linux system][dep-linux] and [macOS][macOS]. 


## Mips assembly

To edit and execute Mips assembly programs we will use [Mars][mars] (Mips
Assembler and Runtime Simulator). 

- Mars is available on the [department Linux system][dep-linux]. 
- Mars will run on any system (including Windows) as long as you have [Java
installed][java-install]. If you prefer, you may [download][download] and
install Mars on your private computer.

## C programming

The C programming assignments have been developed and tested on the [department
Linux system][dep-linux] and [macOS][macOS]. 

- In practice this means that you should most likely be able to do the C programming
assignments on any computer running Linux or macOS.

## Linux on Windows

If you are using Windows and don't want to install Linux alongside Windows on
your computer (dual boot), one of the following options: 

- Install and use the [Windows subsystem for Linux][wsl]
- Install [VirtualBox][virtualbox] and run a virtual Linux machine. This [tutorial][installing-ubuntu-on-virtual-box] will cover how to install
VirtualBox and set up your first virtual machine, show you how to get Ubuntu and
prepare for installation, and walk you through an installation of Ubuntu.
